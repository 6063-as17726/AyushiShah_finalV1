Idea #1 Gamified wellness 
For this idea, I am imagining a couple of different ways that the project can encourage wellness among the user. First could be a motion sensor using the arduino that can combine with a p5js file that promotes movement and activity. Second could be a meditation interface that can regulate breathing, provide calming audio and visuals. Lastly, there could also be a component of nutrition tracking. I also think it could be interesting if this project uses lights to show the status of wellness someone is maintaining. 

Idea #2 Interactive storytelling 
Using a classic children's story, my idea with this project is to use audio and visuals to narrate a story. Using motion-sensors or buttons, the story can be interactive where the user can maybe choose the scenes.
