Idea #1 Gamified wellness 
For this idea, I am imagining a couple of different ways that the project can encourage wellness among the user. First could be a motion sensor using the arduino that can combine with a p5js file that promotes movement and activity. Second could be a meditation interface that can regulate breathing, provide calming audio and visuals. Lastly, there could also be a component of nutrition tracking. I also think it could be interesting if this project uses lights to show the status of wellness someone is maintaining. 

Idea #2 Interactive storytelling 
Using a classic children's story, my idea with this project is to use audio and visuals to narrate a story. Using motion-sensors or buttons, the story can be interactive where the user can maybe choose the scenes. This could also be used to create storytelling that is more accessible, using sounds, and other forms of interactive mediums. 

Idea #3 Garden tracker 
For this idea, I thought I could use the Arduino as a reminder of when plants in someone's garden need water, sunlight, etc. In this case, p5.js could serve as almost a repository of all the data for different plants, and could create visuals depicting how well the plants are thriving.The Arduino could use lights, sounds, and haptics to send notifications regarding plant care.
